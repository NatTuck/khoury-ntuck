# CS3650: A Day of Python

## First Thing
 
 - Homework Questions

## Scripting Languages

Why?

 - Extension of shell scripting. You can do a lot in the Unix shell,
   but it gets awkward for anything but very small programs.

What?

 - High level languages: A few lines of code do a lot.
 - Programs exist as source code. No compilation step.
 - Fast startup. A short program can start, run, and exit quickly.
 - Easy access to OS functionality (like system calls).
 - Good at text processing.
 - Two standard data structures:
   - Dynamic array
   - Hash table

Three major examples on Linux:
 
 - Perl
 - Python
 - Ruby

High level dynamic languages that are not "scripting languages" in this sense:

 - Racket - Not optimized for OS access, hash tables, or string processing.
 - JavaScript - Not optimized for OS access or string processing.
 - Anything on the JVM (e.g. Groovy) - Slow startup.

Python is the lamest of the three. We'll look at Python.

## Python Basics

 - Open a text file, traditionally named whatever.py

## The Cool Things about Python

 - List comprehensions.
 - Range syntax.
 - NumPy / SciPy

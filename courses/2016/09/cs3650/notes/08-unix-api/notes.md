# First Thing
 
 - Homework Questions

# Function Pointers

 - Show map example.

# Malloc and Free

 - p = malloc(nn) allocates a block of nn bytes from the heap.
 - free(p) gives that memory back
 - let's make map actually work correctly
 - Print address of something malloc'd compared to &main and something on the stack.

# Structs

 - Passing nn around is silly. Let's extend map with fat pointers.
 - In C we need to say "struct foo" whenever we use a foo.

# Typedefs

 - Function pointers and structs are obnoxious.
 - Let's rename our types to something reasonable.

# Headers, Macros
 
 - Let's put int\_vec in a separate file.
 - Header.
 - Include guards.

# Generics
 
 - We don't have them. That's what C++ does. We can do without, it just sucks.

# Evil Macros, Static Functions

 - If we have time.

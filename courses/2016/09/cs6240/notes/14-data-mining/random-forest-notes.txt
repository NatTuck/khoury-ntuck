== Decision Trees ==

Given a record, we can classify it by feeding it into a decision tree.

 - Each non-leaf node in the tree is a question. Each possible answer is
   an out-edge. 
 - We start at the root and ask the root question of the record. We follow
   the edge associated with the answer.
 - When we get to a leaf, that's our classification.
 ...
 - Classification may be a probability histogram (e.g. 2/3 A, 1/3 B).

Example:

                                Does it live on land?
            Yes                                                     No
     Does it have wings?                                    Does it Breathe Air?
    Yes               No                                 Yes                    No
   Bird              Cow                                Whale                  Fish




To generate a tree:
 - For each remaining attribute, calculate information gain (reduction in entropy) for
   picking that attribute for the root of the subtree.
 - Pick the maximum.
 - Remove it from the attribute set, recurse.
 - Stop when you run out of attributes or data points.


-- Maximize Information Gain --
H(p/(p+n), n/(p+n)) = -(p/(p+n))log(p/(p+n) - (n/(p+n))log(n/(p+n))   [log base 2]
EH(A) = sum(1..k) of [ ((p_i + n_i) / (p + n)) * H( (p_i / (p_i + n_i)), (n_i / (p_i + n_i)) ) ]
I(A) = H(p/(p+n), n/(p+n)) - EH(A)

-- Minimize Gini Impurity --
sum [ non-matching items in bucket / total items in bucket ]


Continuous attributes:
 - Split into multiple attributes binary attributes.
   - Can pick split points randomly.
   - Pick the record values as potential split points.
 - Treat those binary attributes just like other binary attributes in the data.

Tree Height: ~10?
# of Trees: ~200?

Age	Income		Abortion?	Guns?		Car		Vote
60	40k		F		F		Toyota		R
22	15k		T		T		Ford		D
30	60k		F		T		Toyota		R
40	70k		T		F		Ford		D
81	30k		F		F		GM		D
45	90k		F		T		Honda		R


Which attribute to pick for root?

Abortion?

T = DD
F = RRRD

Gini Impurity = 0/2 + 0/2 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 3/4 = 1.5


Guns?

T = DRR
F = RDD

Gini Impurity = 2/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 2/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 2.33


Abortion is a better choice for the tree root than guns.


Continuous attributes: Consider each value as a cutoff for a < comparision,
test as separate questions.

So (age < 60), (age < 22), (age < 30), etc...

Derive an attribute?
 - Old = age >= 60.

Discrete, non-binary attributes
 - N-way branch?
 - Equality to specific value?
 - Derive an attribute?

== Random Forests ==

We're going to generate several random trees. To classify new data, we run it through all
the trees and take the most popular answer.

To randomize, do both of:
 - Select a random subset of features.
 - Select a random subset of records.

Repeat for each node in each tree.

To use:

- Run your new datapoint through each tree.
- Sum the results.
- Highest score classification wins.

== Baseball Hall of Fame ==

To be included in the hall of fame, a player must:
 - Have played for 10 years.
 - Have been retired for five years.
 - Be voted in by committee within a 20 year window.

Can we predict who will be included in the hall of fame next?

Records:
 - Baseball players. The data we have is spread across a bunch of files,
   so we'll need to do a processing step to pull them together.

 - Players who retired before 2000 are our training set.
 - Players who retired between 2000 and 2009 are our test set.
 - Players retiring after 2009 we can make predictions about.

Attributes:
 - player ID
 - By year:
   - Games Played
   - Awards Earned
   - Batting: Batting Average
   - Batting: Home Runs
   - Colleges played for
   - Pitcher?
   - Pitching: Earned Run Average (hits / 9 innings)
   - Teams played on.
   - Played?
   - Salary

How do we normalize these attributes to be per player?
   - Total # or #/year? Games played? Home runs?
   - Flag vs. count? Both? 
     - Played for Texas A&M University vs. Played for 2 schools
     - Was MVP? Was MVP twice? Got 10 awards?
     - Played for Yankees vs. Played for 5 teams?
   - Year data
     - Year started?
     - Year retired?
     - Played in 1977 vs. played for 12 years.
   - Salary?
     - Total salary
     - Average salary
     - Inflation?
       - Total / average normalized to 2010 dollars?
   
What's the earned run average for someone who didn't pitch?
   - Could use trinary decisions on ERA field - above, below, n/a.
   - Alternatively, can just pick an arbitrary value for non-pitchers (e.g. 100).
     - But then trees will have to use ERA twice to distinguish on this field properly.

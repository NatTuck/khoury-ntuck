<h1>CS 6240 - Parallel Data Processing with Map-Reduce</h1>

<p>Explore to the underlying principles of the distributed processing of large
data sets. Gain an understanding of the performance and usability tradeoffs of
various data analytics infrastructures. Work with large data sets and conduct
practical experiments with machine learning techniques. Gain a working
knowledge of technologies such as Hadoop and Spark and an insight into their
implementation. The class builds on known principles such as the design recipe,
testing and code reviews.

<h2>Work For This Class</h2>

<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>

<p>Every week or two you will be given a homework assignment to complete. Homework
assignments will be posted to <a href="http://bottlenose.ccs.neu.edu/">Bottlenose</a>,
and work should be submitted there as well.

<p>The last assignment will be a small project, worth the same points as two homeworks.</p>

<p>Assignments are due at 11pm on the specified day. Late submissions will recieve an automatic
50% point deduction. Submissions more than a day late will recive a 100% point deduction.

<h3>Blackboard Modules</h3>

<p>NU Online Blackboard: <a href="http://nuonline.neu.edu">http://nuonline.neu.edu</a>

<p>Each week you are expected to review the lesson material and complete the
online quiz for a module on NU Online Blackboard. This should be completed before class
so you are prepared for the lecture and any in-class questions.

<h3>In-Class Coding</h3>

<p>There will in-class coding assignments approximately weekly. Make sure to bring your
laptop to class. These are due at the end of class, and should be submitted online through
Bottlenose. 

<h3>Participation</h3>

<p>You are expected to use the online discussion forum, and to answer questions asked by
your classmates. This will be graded by looking at total number of posts and number of good
answers.

<p>Questions will occasionally be asked in class of a random student. Being present and
answering will contribute slightly to your in-class coding grade. Not being present will hurt
your slightly.

<h2>Policies</h2>

<h3>Collaboration &amp; Sharing Code</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You must personally write the code you submit for assignments. For team assignments,
    if any, the code must be written by the members of the team.</li>
  <li>Discussion with other students outside your team is fine, but the result
    of any such discussion cannot be code, nor should other students see any
    code you have written. To be safe, don't have homework discussions in front
    of a computer with an editor window open.</li>
  <li>Any cases of code plagarism - which is when you submit code written by someone else -
    will recive a zero on the assignment and will be reported to OSCCR. A second offense will
    result in an F for the course.</li>
  <li>Starting with code provided by the professor or provided as example code with the libraries
    used in the course (e.g. Hadoop, Spark) is OK. If this use isn't 100% obvious, make sure to
    note it in your source file (e.g. /* Based on the WordCount example from Hadoop */).
</ul>

<h3>Grade Challenges</h3>

<p>If you want to contest a grade once you've recieved it, this class uses a
variant of the "coach's challenge" system to resolve such challenges. Here are the rules:

<ul>
  <li>Once you recieve a grade on Bottlenose, you have one week to challenge it.</li>
  <li>Challenges are recorded as an in-class coding assignment. In order to issue a challenge, 
    you must spend half the points on the assignment.</li>
  <li>When you issue a challenge, I will re-grade the assignment.</li>
  <li>If you end up with a higher score, you get your points back.</li>
  <li>If not, you lose the spent points.</li>
  <li>If you run out of points, you can no longer issue challenges.</li>
</ul>

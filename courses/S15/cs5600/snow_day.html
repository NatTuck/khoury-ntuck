<h1>CS 5600 - Snow Day Material</h1>

<p>Due to crazy weather and Monday holidays, we're only getting one lecture
in the first six weeks of the semester.</p>

<p>Here's a YouTube playlist with a video lecture that covers the "Processing
and Threads" slides that we should have covered two weeks ago, as well as the
first two projects:</p>

  5600 Snow Day Lecture Playlist</a></p>

<p>This is *the lecture* on this material. It's not the greatest quality - me
saying "um" repeatedly is more distracting in video format than in class - but we're
down three classes...</p>

<h2>Project 1</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Project 1 is due on Sunday, February 22nd, at 11:59pm. That's the night
  before our next scheduled class.</li>
  <li>If you have questions about Project 1, please post on Piazza (privately
  if nessisary), come to office hours, or make an appointment with either me or
  the TA.</li>
  <li>The Project 1 due date will not be pushed back again.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only useful information for Project 1 missing in the video lecture above
is the basics of Mutexes and Semaphores. If you're not already familiar with this
topic, look at the Synchronization and Deadlock slides and the associated textbook
reading.</p>

<h2>Project 2</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Project 2 is described in the videos above.</li>
  <li>Project 2 is due on March 16th.</li>
  <li>Project 2 is harder than Project 1. Start early.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Midterm</h2>

<p>The midterm exam is delayed until further notice.</p>

<h2>Course Description</h2>

<p>In this course you will be learning what an operating system is, what it
does, and how it works. Unless you're working on a very simple embedded
microcontroller, every program you write will run on some operating system and
rely on it for basic services like memory allocation, thread and process
scheduling, access to a file system, networking, and many other things. Having
some idea of how an operating system does these things is useful.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://ccs.neu.edu/home/cbw">Prof Christo Wilson</a> for
the course materials and course page text.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>In the projects for this course, you will implement many of the core features
of an operating system. This will require writing and debugging low level code
in a Linux command-line environment. You should be familiar with ssh, gcc, make,
and an editor like emacs or vim.</p>

<p>Students taking this course are expected to be fluent in low-level
programming in C. If you are not familiar with managing memory, dealing with
pointers, and data structures in C, then you will not be able to complete the
assignments in this course. You will also need to debug low-level code -
including x86 assembly - so experience with gdb is recommended.</p>

<h2>Textbook</h2>

<p><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">Operating Systems: Three
  Easy Pieces</a> by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C.  Arpaci-Dusseau.</p>

<p>The book is available online, but buying a copy is not a bad idea.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>There will be four programming projects throughout the semester. Programming
projects are due at 11:59:59pm on the specified date. We will use a turn-in
script to create a compressed archive of the project files, timestamp them, and
submit them for grading. These projects require significant design and coding,
hence students are recommended to start early!</p>

<p>In this class, you will be building key components of the Pintos operating
system. Pintos is a small OS developed at Stanford that is specifically
designed for teaching OS concepts. Pintos runs inside the QEMU emulator, which
will enable you to debug your operating system as it is running. We have
installed all necessary software for you on the CCIS Linux machines, although
you are welcome to setup Pintos on your own machine as well.</p>

<p>You can get started with Pintos by looking at <a href="pintos/pintos.html">
  the documentation</a>. The Introduction section explains how to setup your
environment and run Pintos on the CCIS Linux machines. All of the documentation
for the four projects is also available from the Pintos docs.</p>

<p>You can download a <a href="pintos/pintos.tar.gz">tarball of pintos</a>.</p>

<p>You will form groups of three people to do the projects. I will allow you to
form your own groups; if you are having trouble finding a partner, post a
notice to Piazza. As you are free to choose your partners, I will not be
sympathetic to complaints at the end of the semester about how your group-mates
did not do any work. All group members should be involved in all major design
decisions, and groups should develop a programming plan that can be effectively
parallelized. You may switch groups between programming projects.</p>

<h2>Exams</h2>

<p>There will be one midterm and one final. All exams will be closed book and
closed notes, and computers are not allowed nor is any access to the Internet
via any device. The exams will cover material from lectures, readings, and the
projects. The final will be cumulative, so review everything!</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<ul>
  <li>60% Projects (15% each)</li>
  <li>15% Midterm</li>
  <li>20% Final</li>
  <li>5% Participation</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project will include a breakdown of how it will be graded.</p>

<h2>Regrading Requests</h2>

<p>In this class, we will use a variant of the <a
  href="http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/nfl-review-rules2.htm">Coach's
Challenge</a> to handle requests for regrading. Each student is allotted two
(2) challenges each semester. If you want a project or a test to be regraded,
you must come to the professors office hours and make a formal challenge
specifying (a) the problem or problems you want to be regraded, and (b) for
each of these problems, why you think the problem was misgraded. If it turns
out that there has been an error in grading, the grade will be corrected, and
you get to keep your challenge. However, if the original grade was correct,
then you permanently lose your challenge. Once your two challenges are
exhausted, you will not be able to request regrades.  <strong>You may not
challenge the use of slip days, or any points lost due to
lateness.</strong></p>
    
<p>Note that, in the case of projects, all group members must have an available
challenge in order to contest a grade. If the challenge is successful, then all
group members get to keep their challenge. However, if the challenge is
unsuccessful, then all group members permamently lose one challenge.</p>

<h2>Late Policy</h2>

<p>For programming projects, we will use flexible slip days. Each student is given
four (4) slip days for the semester. You may use the slip days on any project
during the semester in increments of one day. For example, you can hand in one
project four days late, or one project two days late and two projects one day
late. You do not need to ask permission before using slip days; simply turn in
your assignment late and the grading scripts will automatically tabulate any
slip days you have used.</p>

<p>Slip days will be deducted from each group member's remaining slip days. Keep
this stipulation in mind: if one member of a group has zero slip days
remaining, then that means the whole group has zero slip days remaining.</p>

<p>After you have used up your slip days, any project handed in late will be
marked off 20% for each day late or fraction thereof. Being one second late is
the same as being 23 hours late.</p>

<p><strong>This late policy is extremely generous. Make sure to save your slip
days for when you really need them - they're all you get.</strong></p>

<h2>Cheating Policy</h2>

<p>Projects must be entirely the work of the students turning them in, i.e. you
and your group members. Copying code from other students (past or present) or
websites is strictly prohibited. All project code submitted by students will be
scanned by plagiarism detection software. If you have any questions about using
a particular resource, ask the course staff or post a question to the class
forum.</p>

<p>All students are subject to the Northeastern University <a
  href="http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/">Academic
Integrity Policy</a>. All cases of suspected plagiarism or other academic
dishonesty will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict
Resolution (OSCCR).</p>

<h2>Accomodations for Students with Disabilities</h2>

<p>If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic accommodations
in this course and have not yet met with a Disability Specialist, please visit
www.northeastern.edu/drc and follow the outlined procedure to request services.
If the Disability Resource Center has formally approved you for an academic
accommodation in this class, please present the instructor with your "Professor
Notification Letter" during the first week of the semester, so that we can
address your specific needs as early as possible.</p>

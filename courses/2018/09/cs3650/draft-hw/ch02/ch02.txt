Working on a team of up to two students:

Build two memory allocators:

 - hw07+mutex - Starting from either partner's hw07 solution, add a mutex protecting 
   the global freelist. Make no other changes.
 - optimized - Write a new memory allocator optimized for the included test cases.
   Use advanced technques as discussed in class. You may unreasonably optimize for
   these specific cases, but your allocator should still work for other cases.

Benchmark three allocators:

 - The system allocator.
 - Your hw07+mutex allocator.
 - Your optimized allocator.

Provide a report and graph describing your results.

Peformance expectations:

 - Your optimized allocator should definitely be faster than hw07+mutex.
 - For full credit, you should beat the system allocator.

Students start with 50 points.

The autograder should do a decent job on correctness, so the deductions
for this assignment are mostly about good practice.

Apply a penalty for each category of error once, and mark the other cases

Deductions:

 - Malloc without corresponding free: -2 each max -10
 - Other clear memory error: -2 each max -10
    - E.g. Return pointer to invalid stack frame
    - E.g. Array index OOB
 - Errors in using standard library functions: -2 each, max -10
    - E.g. Didn't check return value of fgets.
    - E.g. Used "gets".
 - Inconsistent code formatting (-1 each, max -5).
 - Subjectively bad code (-1 each, max -5), clear comment about why it's bad.
 - No serious attempt at the problem at all: -20
 - Code follows a plan that doesn't work and clearly couldn't work: -10
   - Point out why.

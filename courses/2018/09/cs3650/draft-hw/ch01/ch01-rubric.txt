CS3650-02, Spring 2018, CH01 Rubric

Students start with 50 points. Max deduction is -50.

The autograder should do a decent job on correctness, so the deductions
for this assignment are mostly about good practice.

Make sure to scan the submitted code and keep an eye out for 1.) really lame
submissions (e.g. prints correct output based on script file name) or 2.)
plagarism. In these cases, let Prof Tuck know.

== Common deductions: ==

- Inconsistent code formatting (-1 each, max -5).
- Subjectively bad code (-1 each, max -5), clear comment about why it's bad.

== Features: ==

Expected features are: redirect in, redirect out, pipe, semicolon, and, or,
background, exit, cd.

Look at the code. For each feature:
No attempt at the feature, -4.
The implementation is very specific to the test case (e.g. && checks for “true” command), -2.
Otherwise, no penalty for a bad attempt at the feature

== Clear Errors ==

It's an error if memory is leaked structurally (e.g. a pointer is reassigned
without freeing the old value or the only reference is lost on function return).
If there was still a reference on exit or exec, that’s fine. fork occurs, but
there isn’t an associated wait in the right place to get deterministic ordering
and this wasn’t supposed to be a background task Other similar errors that are
objectively bugs.

Memory leaks: -2 each max -10.

When adjusting file descriptors, stray file descriptors shouldn't be left open.

Stray file descriptor left open: -1
Stray file descriptor in parent process: -2

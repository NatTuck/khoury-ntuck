CS3650-02 Spring 2018 HW01 Rubric

************

Important:

 - For grading in 3650-02 this semester we don't want to go light on the students.
 - If you have any doubt about whether you should take off points, take off the points.
   Students can recover points by challenging grades, but grades that are too good tend
   not to get fixed.

***********

=== HW02 ===

There are 50 points available for manual grading. This is in addition to autograding,
so it's OK if there are cases where students are only penalized by the autograder for
errors.

Program 1: Calculator

Deductions:

 1. Program doesn't have a separate function (jal to label, jr $ra to get back) for each
    of the four operations: -5
 2. Didn't use the read-string system call: -5
 3. Read input numbers in main function: -5
 4. Program is wrong (explain why it's not working): up to -3
 5. Program is subjectively bad (explain what's bad): up to -2

Program 2: Fibonacci

See the slides here: "How to write an ASM program":
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/ntuck/courses/2018/01/cs3650/notes/03-asm-recipe/

 1. Didn't use naive recursive strategy (two recursive calls): -10
 2. Didn't use stack following conventions shown in class: -5
   (specifically, should have prologue and epilogue managing stack frames, should follow
    register saving conventions for $s (callee save) and $t (caller save) registers).
 4. Program is wrong (explain why it's not working): up to -3
 5. Program is subjectively bad (explain what's bad): up to -2

Following instructions:

 1. Not a gzipped tarball: -1
 2. No top level directory: -1
 3. Stray dotfiles: -1
 4. Submitted Mars JAR: -1
 5. Did something that broke the autograder: explain what's wrong: -1

CS3650-02 Spring 2018 HW01 Rubric

************

Important:

 - For grading in 36502 this semester we don't want to go light on the students.
 - If you have any doubt about whether you should take off points, take off the points.
   Students can recover points by challenging grades, but grades that are too good tend
   not to get fixed.

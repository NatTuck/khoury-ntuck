HW07 Rubric:

Students start with 50 points.

Since the rubric includes correcting for autograder inaccuracy, the manual grading score may be below zero or above 50. The total
score should stay in the range 0-100.

Autograder refunds:

If a student has lost a significant number of points on the autograder, check their code to see if we can give partial credit.

 - There are two pieces here: successfully allocating memory and getting coalescing to work so the stats are right.
 - Consider the tests that failed, and examine the code to see if they were "close".
 - Give a refund of up to 1 point per failed test for being close.

Common deductions:

 - Stray dotfiles / binaries / etc: -1 each, max -3
 - Inconsistent code formatting (-1 each, max -5).
 - Clear logic errors, especially in regard to pointers / memory access: -5 each, max -20
   Give a comment explaining the error.
 - Subjectively bad code: -1 or -2 each, max -5
   Give a comment explaining the error.

Specific deductions:

 - Didn't manage free memory as a linked list: -10
 - Didn't manage free memory usefully at all: -20
 - Didn't handle large vs. small allocations as specified:
   - Didn't split properly: -5
   - Didn't handle large allocations directly with mmap/munmap: -5
 - Coalescing logic was wrong: -1
   - Point out where

Bonuses:

 - Especially nice implementations of stuff: +1 each, max +3

Plagiarism:

 - For any code copying, check for attribution comments.
   - No attribution at all, let me know.

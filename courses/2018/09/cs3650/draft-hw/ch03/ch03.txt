<p><strong>The Assignment</strong>

<p>Extend your file system from HW09 to support more functionality:

<ul>
<li>Subdirectories and nested directories.
<li>Read and write from files larger than one block. For example, you should be able to support one hundred 1k files or five 100k files.
<li>Create directories and nested directories. Directory depth should only be limited by space. 
<li>Remove directories.
<li>Hard links.
<li>Symlinks
<li>Support metadata (permissions and timestamps) for files and directories. 
<li>Anything else that's covered in the tests.
</ul>

<p>This is a team assignment. You have two HW09's as starter code, and your team only needs to make one submission for this assignment.

<p>The TAs will be manually testing your submission for requested functionality that isn't fully covered by the automated tests. 

<p><strong>To Submit</strong>

<p>A .tar.gz archive containing source code and no stray files.

## Broad Goals

  - Deployment
    - Everyone has their own (virtual) Linux server.
    - Every assignment includes deploying the application
      to the actual web.
    - Deployment can be tricky (until it's automated for
      your actual app).
    - The only way to make it hurt less is practice.
    - Result: You should be able to effectivley build and 
      deploy non-trivial web applications by yourself.
  - Technology changes quickly.
    - We worked with Phoenix and React this semester.
    - You will worth with other things in the future.
    - Learning new stuff is a skill that requires practice.
    - Result: When you get a job where you use Clojure/Ring,
      Cassandra, and Vue, you should be able to figure it 
      out.

# Computer Systems

## First Thing

 - Questions on the Homework?

## Programming in C
 
 - Let's write "prime", which prints the Nth prime number.
 - Top-down design.
   - Allocate an array for N primes.
   - Pre-load first 3 primes.
   - A number is-prime if it's not divisible by any prime up to sqrt(x).
 - Makefile first.
   - gcc command
   - clean rule
   - tabs
 - learn a Unix editor: vim or emacs
   - vimtutor
 - test C assignments on Linux server
 - Specifics:
   - Local variables are "on the stack".
   - Can allocate arrays "on the stack".
   - Standard library functions and headers:
     - stdio.h: printf
     - stdlib.h: atol
     - math.h: ceil, sqrt -- show manpage, talk about libm
   - Casts. For numbers, these convert.

## Arrays and Pointers

 - Arrays in C are just like arrays in ASM. They're a contigous sequence of
   memory starting at some address.
 - Array variables store the address of the start of the array.
 - C knows how big the type stored in array is.
 - For arrays in ASM, we had to manually calculate the byte offsets.
 - An array of words in C would be xs[0], xs[1], etc.
 - Pointers are variables that store memory addresses with an associated type
   so "int\*" (int pointer) is the address of an int.
 - C lets you do arthmetic with pointers.
   - If you add one to an int pointer, it steps to the next int-sized chunk of memory.
     So if p is a pointer to a 4 byte int, then (p + 1) is the address increased by
     4 bytes.
 - Array varibles and pointers are the same thing with different notation.
 - If pp is a pointer and aa is an array, both of the same type pointing to the same
   address, then pp[3] and \*(pp + 3) are the same thing.
 - Strangely, pp[ii] and ii[pp] are the same thing too.
   - Why?

## Overflow

 - Segfaults
 
 ```
 gcc -o segfault segfault.c
 ./segfault
 ```
 
 - GDB
   - gdb ./cmd
   - run
   - bt
   - frame X
   - print X
   - break
   - help

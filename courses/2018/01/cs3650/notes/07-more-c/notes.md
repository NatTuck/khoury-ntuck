# Computer Systems

## First Thing

 - Questions on the Homework?

## Programming in C
 
 - Let's write insertion sort.
   - Result array is empty, so starts in order.
   - For each item in input, insert into output array in correct slot.
 - Makefile first.
   - gcc command
   - clean rule
   - tabs

## Map in C

 - Function Pointers
 - Complain about no generics

## C Preprocessor

 - Includes just copy and paste.
 - if / end for conditional compliation
 - Can fake generics, but it's awful

## Calculator

 - We have tokenizer.
 - "tokenize" outputs list
   - Explain structs, svec.
 - Parse takes list and builds AST.
   - Maybe start with eval-in-place?
   - Show AST struct.
 - AST can be evaluated.

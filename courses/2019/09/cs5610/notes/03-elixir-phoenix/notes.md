## JS Events

 - Show (don't type) js/page.html and js/code.js
 - Multiple script tags executed in order as page is processed.
 - DOM: browser provides an API to access the web page.
 - Event loop:
   - The JS engine has a main loop that waits for events to occur
     then runs the associated code.
   - This is sequential, but can appear to be (and is logically)
     concurrent - we may not know execution order of event handlers.
 - onclick attribute - not good style in modern code, but works
 - better style: addEventListener
 - Async events: setTimeout, setInterval
 - best practice: All code in external js, wrapped in anonymous
   function to avoid polluting scope.
 - Once we start using full toolchain, it'll do modules so we
   won't need to do manual wrapping.
 - Modules are implemented using anonymous function scopes.

## Elixir Language

Why would you pick a specific language?

 - You know it.
 - It has good libraries for your domain. (e.g. FORTRAN has fast FFTs)
 - Not using it requires extra effort. (JavaScript runs in web browsers)
 - The language itself does something that you want. 
   (Rust provides a set of type system enforced safety guarantees.)
 - It has specific performance properties. (C++ is fast for video games
   because it compiles to machine code and has no garbage collector.)

Sequential vs. Concurrent Programming

 - Traditionally, computer programs run sequentially.
 - The computer systems they run on aren't sequential.
   - You can't buy a single core laptop, or even a *phone*, in 2018.
   - Web programming is distributed, which can't be sequential.
   - Web applications have multiple concurrent users.
   - Web *servers* tend to be distributed too, to allow web applications
     to scale *lots* of concurrent users.
   - Draw the multi-web-server, one DB, multi-client picture.
 - Standard solution:
   - Web app is sequential.
   - Run a copy of it for each user request.
   - These copies only interact at the database, which handles any 
     concurrency issues.
   - This works well for many apps, but is silly for apps like "draw".

The Elixir and Erlang Languages:

 - Erlang was developed in the 80's at Ericson for telcom switches.
 - It's a compiled-to-bytecode-with-VM language like Java or C#.
 - Tuned for two specific properties:
   - Reliability
   - Concurrency (initially for reliablity)
 - Built for telecom switches, where “the service will be down for maintenence” 
   is simply not OK.
 - Lightweight processes.
 - “Let it crash”
 - The semantics of Erlang are great.
 - High reliability and a focus on concurrency are awesome for web apps.
 - Erlang syntax is the absolute worst. You literally can’t use user-defined 
   functions in an “if” condition, as a *syntax* rule.
 - Elixir is a language for the Erlang BEAM VM with the Erlang semantics but
   much less painful syntax.

The Elixir plan for web apps:

 - Each request is handled by a new Erlang process.
 - Erlang processes can be used to store state, or to manage long-running
   client connections.
 - Safe communication between processes, even across multiple servers, is
   innately provided by the VM.

The language itself is similar to ISL from PDP / Fundies 1:

 - Elixir is a lot like ISL.
 - Functional language
 - Can't mutate data.
 - Can't re-assign variables.
 - Linked lists as core data type
 - No loop statements
 - Repeat by recursion
 - Loop functions: map, filter, reduce
 - Interactive REPL

But with some extra features not in ISL:

 - Non-LISP syntax
 - Seperate function / variable namespaces
 - Modules
 - Pattern matching
 
 - Side effects (like I/O)
 - Maps (associative arrays) are a core data type
 - Lightweight processes
 - send / receive 

## Elixir examples:

 - Fib
   - Compile Fib
   - Call Fib.fib from REPL (iex)
   - Pattern matching for functions
 - Fact
   - Accumulator pattern
   - Note tail recursion
 - RW
   - ElixirScript
   - Loop functions
   - Functions have module prefixes
   - Pipelines

## Phoenix Framework / Practice App

```
# clone git repo
$ git clone https://github.com/NatTuck/elixir-practice.git
$ cd elixir-practice

# fetch deps
$ mix deps.get
$ (cd assets && npm install)

# run local dev server
$ mix phx.server
```

 - Double a number.

HTTP story for doubling a number.

 - HTTP GET /
   - Reply: Index page.
 - HTTP POST /double
   - Request: Send value to double
   - Response: Show result page.

We can think of a HTTP request as being like a function call. The server
needs to take inputs (request path, query string, post data) and produce an
output (the response).

We can think of Phoenix as being a tool that helps us define those functions.

The basic flow in Phoenix is:

```
request
 |> router 
 |> pipeline
 |> controller action 
 |> view
 |> template
```

Let's walk through that for doubling a number.

Note that most of the logic is in lib/pratice_web, where
the web-specific stuff lives, but that we eventually call
out to a file outside that directory to actually double
the number. Our app could conceptually end up having,
e.g., a command line interface that doesn't use HTTP
and the code to double a number would still be used.


### Deployment

Multiple users on the server:

 - We already have two users on the server:
   - root, which has full admin access
   - a login user, which is where we ssh in and where our
     static web site data lives
 - Whenever we add another web application, we should add a new
   user account for it.
   - This gives us a separate home directory to put files associated
     with that app.
   - This provides a level of isolation between apps. If something goes
     wrong with one app, it shouldn't break anything else.
 - Only use root (sudo) when nessisary. That's four basic cases:
   - Editing system config files (in /etc)
   - Managing system services (e.g. "sudo service nginx restart")
   - Installing debian packages (e.g. "sudo apt-get install ...")
   - Globally upgrading npm. (e.g. "sudo npm install -g npm")
 - For all other tasks, make sure you're acting as the non-root user
   associated with the app you're working on.
 - If you use root where it isn't needed you'll end up with broken
   file permissions and your apps will break (or worse).

How to deploy:

 - Create "pratice" user on server.
 - Clone git repo to server.
 - Read deploy.sh - do TODOs.
 - Double check config/prod.exs - set URL.
 - Run deploy.sh
 - Install nginx config file.
 - Read start.sh - do TODOs.
 - Run start.sh
 - Create and install a systemd service file for your app.
   - File goes in /etc/systemd/

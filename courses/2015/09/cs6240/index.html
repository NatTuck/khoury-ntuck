    <h1>CS 6240 - Parallel Data Processing in MapReduce</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Graduate course. This course covers techniques for analyzing very large
    data sets. We introduce the MapReduce programming model and the core
    technologies it relies on in practice, such as a distributed file system.
    Related approaches and technologies from distributed databases and Cloud
    Computing will also be introduced. Particular emphasis is placed on
    practical examples and hands-on programming experience. Both plain
    MapReduce and database-inspired advanced programming models running on top
    of a MapReduce infrastructure will be used.</p>

    <!--
    <p>This course will be based on the existing course by 
      <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/mirek/">Prof. Mirek Riedewald</a>.

   <h2>Special Accomodations</h2>

   <p>If the Disability Resource Center has formally approved you for an
   academic accommodation in this class, please present the instructor with

   <h2>Academic Integrity Policy</h2>

   <p>A commitment to the principles of academic integrity is essential to the
   mission of Northeastern University. The promotion of independent and
   original scholarship ensures that students derive the most from their
   educational experience and their pursuit of knowledge. Academic dishonesty
   violates the most fundamental values of an intellectual community and
   undermines the achievements of the entire University.</p>

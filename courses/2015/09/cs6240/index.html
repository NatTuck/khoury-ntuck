    <h1>CS 6240 - Parallel Data Processing in MapReduce</h1>

    <p>Graduate course. This course covers techniques for analyzing very large
    data sets. We introduce the MapReduce programming model and the core
    technologies it relies on in practice, such as a distributed file system.
    Related approaches and technologies from distributed databases and Cloud
    Computing will also be introduced. Particular emphasis is placed on
    practical examples and hands-on programming experience. Both plain
    MapReduce and database-inspired advanced programming models running on top
    of a MapReduce infrastructure will be used.</p>

    <p>This course will be based on the existing course by 
      <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/mirek/">Prof. Mirek Riedewald</a>.

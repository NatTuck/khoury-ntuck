    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>This course introduces the essential mathematics upon which Computer
    Science depends. We're going to spend a semester on counting things. We're
    going to count in a circle, make sets of things to count, prove that our
    counts are correct, count how many operations algorithms take, count how
    many different ways a die can roll, etc.</p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Online Homework - 10%</li>
      <li>Problem Sets - 25%</li>
      <li>Lecture Quizzes - 5%</li>
      <li>Midterm Exam - 25%</li>
      <li>Final Exam - 35%</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Problem Sets and Online Homework</h2>

    <p>There will be one problem set per week, due on Monday. This must be
    prepared as a PDF and submitted through Bottlenose by midnight on the
    due date.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to the problem sets, there will be one or two shorter online
    homeworks due each week, generally on due Wednesdays and Fridays.</p>

    <p>Late homework will not be accepted.</p>
    
    <p>At the end of the semester, your lowest problem set grade will be dropped.</p>

    <h2>Lecture Quizzes</h2>

    <p>There will be random quizzes given in class throughout the semester. Bring
    paper and a writing implement.</p>

    <p>Lecture quizzes cannot be made up under any circumstances. At the end of
    the semester the lowest two will be dropped to allow for occasional
    absences.</p>

    <h2>Exams</h2>

    <p>There will be two in-class exams. There will be no exam during finals week.</p>

    <p>If you can't attend an exam, please let me know as soon as possible so
    alternative arrangements can be made.</p>

    <h2>Recitations</h2>

    <p>Make sure you're registered for a recitation section. Recitation attendence
    is optional, but provides a good opportunity to see sample problems and ask
    more detailed questions. This is especially valuable for a summer course where
    we'll be covering a lot of material quickly.</p>

    <h2>No Electronics In Class</h2>

    <p>This is a math course. You don't need your computer or phone out. If you
    want to show up to lecture and not pay attention that's fine but you'll
    have to bring a (paper) book to read or something.</p>

    <h2>Collaboration and Academic Honesty</h2>

    <p>I would prefer if you did your problem sets entirely on your own, but
    verbally discussing problems with other students is acceptable as long as
    you follow two rules:</p>

    <ol> 
      <li>If you sought help from or collaborated with any other student, then
      their names must be acknowledged in your solution.</li>
      <li>Your submission must be written entirely by yourself, in your own
      words.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Please make sure you're familar with the <a
      href="http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/">Academic
    Integrity Policy</a>. Any cases of plagarism or unauthorized collaboration
    (e.g. not writing your own problem set submission from scratch) will be
    reported to both the department and the OSCCR. Also, you will recieve an F in
    the course.</p> 

    <h2>Accomodations for Students with Disabilities</h2>

    <p>If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic
    accommodations in this course and have not yet met with a Disability
    Specialist, please visit the <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/drc">DRC
    page</a> and follow the outlined procedure to request services. If the
    Disability Resource Center has formally approved you for an academic
    accommodation in this class, please present the instructor with your
    "Professor Notification Letter" during the first week of the semester, so
    that we can address your specific needs as early as possible.</p>

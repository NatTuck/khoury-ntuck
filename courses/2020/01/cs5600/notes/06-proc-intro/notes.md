## First: HW questions

## HW04

HW04 is posted.

 - Starter code includes a copy of xv6
 - You get to add a syscall.
 - The syscall fills in a struct with counts for how many
   bytes have been read and written for a given open file descriptor.
 - Goals: 
   - Look at the syscall flow
   - Manipulate in-kernel process state

## Today 

Today we're going to go through some slides to fill in more background
on concepts we've started working with already.

## HW10 / Challenge 3

 - HW10 is currently due on Thanksgiving.
 - Currently, the suggestion is to finish HW09 and HW10 early, leaving the
   opportunity to use Wednesday (and even Thursday) on HW10 if desired.
 - Alternatives:
   - Bring the due date forward to Tuesday or Wednesday, making it fair for
     everyone even if they don't want to work over the break.
   - Push the date back to Friday or Saturday, cutting into CH03 time.
 - It's possible to push the CH03 due date back to Friday after reading day, but
   that would be mean to the TAs. CH03 is the most obnoxious assignment of the
   semester to grade.

## Today 
 
 - New Homework
 - Let's take a look at xv6
 
## xv6: An Operating System

 - Clone the xv6 repo.
 - git fetch --tags
 - git checkout xv6-rev8
 - git checkout -b xv6-rev8

At this point, we have the same version as the NEU-local docs.

References: 

 - Repo clone: git clone http://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public
 - Local docs: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/cs3650/unix-xv6/
 
Building and running it:

 - open dedicated terminal
 - make
 - Comment out the error line.
 - make
 - make qemu-nox
 - ls
 - cat README
 - need to kill qemu to exit

Boot process:

 - bootasm.S
 - bootman.c
 - main.c
   - main
   - mpmain
 - proc.c: scheduler
 - stop here
   
Stuff we've already done:

 - usermalloc.c
   - start in morecore
   - uses sbrk
   - uses 4k chunk size
   - look at malloc
   - freep is free list
   - note: return p+1
   - look at free
   - note: return p-1
 - sh.c
   - builds a parse tree
   - executes it
   - neat example of tagged polymorphic struct usage

Stuff we will do:

 - quick look at fs.c
 - we'll have too many slides on this later

Cool stuff:
 - vectors.S
 - trap.c
   - Interrupts!
   - Timer
   - IDE (hard disk)
   - Keyboard
   - Serial port
 - echo.c
   - The echo command.

## IPC: Sockets

 - Pipes
 - Named pipes.
 - UNIX sockets.
 - IP sockets: UDP or TCP
   - UDP: Unreliable packets; basically just IP.
   - TCP: Like a pipe, but might go to another machine.
 - TCP server:
   - socket() -> gives us an FD
   - bind()   -> specifies address
   - listen() -> marks us as a server
   - accept() -> accepts connection, gives new FD
   - now we can send / recv data like read / write to a pipe
   - shutdown() -> signal end of data
   - close()  -> clean up fd
 - TCP client:
   - socket()  -> gives us an FD
   - connect() -> connect to a server
   - now we can send / recv data like read / write to a pipe
   - shutdown() -> signal end of data
   - close()  -> clean up fd

All of these mechanisms are slower than mmaping shared memory,
because they require copying data and system calls to read/write
messages. But... sockets are pretty fast. And socket code is
way easier to get right than shared memory.

 - Take a look at get.c

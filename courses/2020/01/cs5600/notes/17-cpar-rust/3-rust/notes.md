## The Rust Programming Language

For our next homework, we'll be trying one of these langauges that has a
specific design goal of handling data races, concurrency, and paralelism
effecitvely: Rust. Rust is targetted specifically at systems programming -
people are even working on an OS kernel in it.

## Stuff to cover in Rust examples

 - Getting arguments
 - Files + Binary I/O
   - Must use bytes crate
 - Threads + Arc + Mutex

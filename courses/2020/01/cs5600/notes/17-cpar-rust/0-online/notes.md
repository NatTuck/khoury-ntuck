## Online Teaching

 - You've found the lecture.
 - Each online lecture will consist of:
   - A webpage
   - A Q&A / discussion session on Microsoft Teams at lecture time.
 - The webpage will contain text and links, in two distinct categories:
   - Core content: Review this before the lecture-time Q&A
   - Secondary content: This is essential lecture content, but it's
     not nessisary to review it before the Q&A
 - The Q&A will start at the beginning of the scheduled lecture block, and will
   continue for as long as there are questions of general interest to the class.
   - Evidence that you were present at the start of the lecture block for the
     Q&A counts towards your participation grade.
   - When we run out of broad-interest questions, I'll stick around for lower
     priority or 1-on-1 questions.

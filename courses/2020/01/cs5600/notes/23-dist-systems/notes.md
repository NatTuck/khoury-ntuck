# Distributed Systems

## Intro Comments

Last couple lectures:

 - Today: 
   - COW FS commentary
   - I was going to do a distributed systems intro, but someone did it better.
 - Next monday is our final lecture, where we'll do quick semester review.

## COW FS Comentary

Some workflow examples with the solution:
 
 - create a filesystem
 - mount it
 - make a snapshot
 - list versions
 - rollback the snapshot

## External Reference

There's a good set of lectures on distributed systems posted online at
http://www.distributedsystemscourse.com/

The videos are about 10 minutes each. This lecture includes the following two
videos in order to give an overview and more detail on an example (and
interesting) topic in distributed systems.

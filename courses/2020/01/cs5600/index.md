# CS 5610 - Computer Systems

Spring 2020

The course catalog says:

Studies the structure, components, design, implementation, and internal
operation of computer systems, focusing mainly on the operating system level.
Covers current operating system components and construction techniques system
calls, I/O, memory management, and file system structures. Discusses issues
arising from concurrency and distribution, such as scheduling of concurrent
processes, interprocess communication and synchronization, resource sharing and
allocation, and deadlock management and resolution. Includes examples from real
operating systems. Exposes students to the system concepts through programming
exercises. Requires admission to MS program or completion of all transition
courses.

## Course Overview

This course will explore operating system implementation through programming
assignments. This is a programming heavy course; students are expected to be
proficient at programming.

## Likely Major Topics

 * PC hardware / software interface
 * Assembly language: i386 and AMD64
 * Virtual Memory
 * Concurrency with processes and threads
 * Interprocess communication
 * Filesystems
 * Implementing userspace libraries
 * Implementing system calls in an OS kernel

## Likely Grading Structure

 * The majority of the grade - possibly the significant majority - will be
   programming assignments.

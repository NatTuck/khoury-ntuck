## Secondary Lecture Content

This material is also part of this lecture, but not essential for the Q&A. Please
review this content when convenient.

There's a good set of lectures on distributed systems posted online at
http://www.distributedsystemscourse.com/

The videos are about 10 minutes each. The following two videos give an overview
and more detail on an example (and interesting) topic in distributed systems, so
they are the secondary lecture content for today:

# cs2500: Snake Design

## Design Recipie for Big Bang

1. Figure out the constants in the world.
2. Figure out what varies in the world
  - This becomes the data definition for the world.
3. Figure out which big bang clauses you need, and write "main".
  - Functions for these seed your wish list.

## Constants

 - Images: BG, Food, Segment
 - Discuss grid representation.
   - Grid cell size, grid cell count, BG size, pick 2 of 3.

## World State

SnakeWorld

 - Food

Snake

 - Direction
 - Segs (List of Segments) 

## Big-Bang

 - on-tick
 - on-key

## Wish List

 - Start expanding the wish list to get as many function sigs / purps as we can.

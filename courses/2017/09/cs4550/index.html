<h1>CS 4550 - Web Development</h1>

<p>
Discusses Web development for sites that are dynamic, data driven, and
interactive. Focuses on the software development issues of integrating multiple
languages, assorted data technologies, and Web interaction. Requires each
student to deploy individually designed Web experiments that illustrate the Web
technologies and at least one major integrative Web site project. Each student
or team must also create extensive documentation of their goals, plans, design
decisions, accomplishments, and user guidelines.</p>

<h2>Textbook</h2>

<p>There is no required textbook for this class.</p>

<h2>Supplies</h2>

<p>Each student must have virtual private server and a domain name, accessible
from the public internet. Getting these will be part of the first homework
assignment. This will cost around $30 for the semester.</p>

<p>Domain Registrars:
  <a href="https://joker.com/">joker</a>,
  <a href="https://www.gandi.net">gandi</a>,
  <a href="http://www.namecheap.com">namecheap</a>.
  It's easiest if the registrar also provides DNS hosting.
</p>

<p>VPS Providers:
  <a href="https://www.vultr.com/">vultr</a>,
  <a href="https://www.linode.com/">linode</a>,
  <a href="https://www.prgmr.com/">prgmr</a>.
  Your VPS should have Ubuntu 16.04 and at least 1 GB of RAM.</p>

<h2>Work For This Class</h2>

<h3>Homework and Projects</h3>

<p>For each homework assignment or project you will build a working web site
  and/or app. To submit your work, you must do three things:
  <ol>
    <li>Create a release on github.</li>
    <li>Deploy your site/application to your server.</li>
    <li>Submit links to github and your deployed site on
      <a href="https://bottlenose.ccs.neu.edu/">Bottlenose</a>.</li>

<p>Late submissions will be penalized 1% for every hour late, except for the
  last assignment which must be submitted on time for credit.

<h3>Participation</h3>

<h2>Useful Resources</h2>

<h3>Editors</h3>

<p>We will be writing code in several languages. Programming is much easier with
  editor support. Most editors will do HTML / CSS / JS well out of the box. Elixir
  is supported less broadly - these editors should work well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vim -
    <a href="https://github.com/elixir-editors/vim-elixir">vim-elixir</a></li>

  <li>Emacs - elixir-mode</li>

  <li><a href="http://spacemacs.org">Spacemacs</a> - layer: elixir</li>

  <li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> - packages: language-elixir auto-ident</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policies</h2>

<h3>Special Accomodations</h3>

<p>Students needing disability accommodations should visit the
  <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/drc/about-the-drc/">Disability
    Resource Center (DRC)</a>.</p>

<p>If you have been granted special accomodations either through the DRC
  or as a student athlete, let me know as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Code Copying &amp; Collabaration Policy</h3>

<p>Copying code and submitting it without proper attribution is strictly
prohibited in this class. This is plagiarism, which is completely unacceptable.

<p><b>Details:</b>

<ul>
  <li>For solo assignments, you should personally write your code either from
    scratch or using only the starter code provided in the assignment.</li>
  <li>For team assignments, if any, your team should do the same.</li>
  <li>The use of published libraries through the standard package tools is
    fine.</li>
  <li>All code will be posted publicaly on Github. In the case of an authorship
    dispute, whoever pushed to Github first wins.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Collaboration and Attribution:</b>

<p>Since it's not plagiarism if you provide attribution, as a special exception
to these rules, any code sharing with attribution will not be treated as a
major offense. Instead, credit will be split between the writers of the code.

<p>In order to qualify for this exception, every collaborator must include a
prominent notice either as a multi-line comment at the top of the submitted
single source file or at the top of a submitted README file identifying all
collaborators.

<p>For example, if four students work together code source, the submission will
be graded as usual and then the points will be split evenly four ways as long
as the collaboration is clearly indicated in the submissions.

<p><b>Penalities:</b>

<p>First Offense:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your final grade will be an F.</li>
  <li>You will be reported to OSCCR and CCIS.</li>
</ul>

# HW01 Catchup

Obvious content:

 - Basic HTML/CSS
 - Administering DNS
 - Setting up a web server
    
Incidental content:

 - The Linux command line
 - Administering a Linux system service
 - A command line editor
 - Dealing with a remote server over SSH
 - Git and Github
 - Running a local Linux VM

Everyone should be able to get the core tasks completed for the homework by the
extended due date tonight.

If your local VM has issues or you aren't comfortable with vim to edit server
config files or you haven't figured out SSH keys, those are worth spending some
time on over the next couple weeks.
